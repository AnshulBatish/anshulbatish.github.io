        <h1>Get To Know The Author:</h1>

        <h2>Legal and Government Issued Identification:</h2>
        <p>My name is Anshul Batish.</p>

        <h2>Oregon State University Issued Email Address:</h2>
        <p>batisha@oregonstate.edu</p>

        <h2>Major Pursuing at Oregon State and Year of Study:</h2>
        <p>I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science and this is my second year studying, therefore I am a Sophomore.</p>

        <h2>What Is The Most Complex Or Interesting Thing You've Done With Your Current Web Development Skills?</h2>
        <p>I had taken a web design course my freshman year of high school in which our final product was a web page dedicated to our idol - in my case, I made
            my website for the late great Kobe Bryant. We were instructed in this class to follow along video tutorials the teacher had prepared beforehand, so
            it never truly felt like I was learning how to create my own webpage with HTML. That's why I'm quite excited to get another oppurtunity to not only learn,
            but apply my knowledge from this course to future endeavors.
        </p>

        <h2>What Do You Hope To Learn From This Class?</h2>
        <p>My goal by the end of the course is to have the skills of developing and designing a website engrained into my memory.</p>

        <h2>Have You Signed Up For Our Course Piazza Forum?</h2>
        <p>Yes, I have signed up for our CS290 Web Development Piazza.</p>

        <h2>Most Interesting Fact About Myself:</h2>
        <p>Ever since second grade, my peers have found amusement in looking at my shirts after completing a physically intensive task. My ability to sweat 
            profoundly with such minimal movement have disgusted, impressed, and have even charmed those who have bestowed their eyes upon my drenched shirts
            and glistening face.
