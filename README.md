    <h3>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment.  How did you work through them?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My biggest obstacle throughout the course of this assignment was getting familiar with git and the process
                of setting git on my terminal. To get started on my journey of learning about git I downnloaded the Git-it
                desktop app that was referenced in the README file. The first four assignments were very straightforward 
                since it required using basic git commands and inputting my GitHub username. It was on the fifth exercise- 
                linking my local repository with a remote one - where I experienced a significant setback. Even though I followed 
                the steps listed on the tutorial, I kept experiencing an error where my terminal was not linked to my GitHub repo. 
                I copy and pasted the error message I recieved into a search engine to diagnose and resolve the issue. I referred 
                git's official page to see what to do. After reading some documentation I realized I had to set up a SSH key for my 
                GitHub account. Following the instructions on the website, I was finally able to link up my terminal with my GitHub 
                repo. The other problem I experienced is that the name for the branch I had was "main" whereas Git-it expected the name 
                "master." This name difference - I presume - caused Git-it to not acknowledge that I completed the task. I confirmed that 
                I had truly pushed my commits to my GitHub repo.

    <h3>What did you learn from this assignment?  What did you already know?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>From attending lectures and reading supplementary html documentation, I learned useful commands to present textual and visual 
                information in an organized manner with headers and lists - for example. It was through this assignment though that I learned 
                the importance of planning things out ahead of time instead of making adjustments on the fly. Just like in CS161 and CS162, 
                the purpose of the design document was to weed out logical errors and have a blueprint so that the coding aspect would take 
                significantly less time. Similarly, I found it more efficient and helpful to create a rough sketch of how I would want my webpage 
                to look like before hard coding it. Just seeing the code makes it quite difficult to visualize what the final product would look 
                like. Instead of having to constatnly refresh the site to see how every small change would look, planning it out ahead of time 
                saved a lot of time and mental strain. In addition to having prior knowledge of the importance of planning, I had very faint 
                experience with HTML from my web design class in my freshman year of high school. Since I had not worked or been exposed to HTML 
                since freshman year, essentially all my understanding of HTML had been reset and I'm learning it on a clean slate.

    <h3>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in 
        completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
    </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In addition to lecture materials, there were a few web resources that I found particularly useful when completing assignment 1. 
                As mentioned in the challenges section, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account">the official documentation</a>
                from GitHub helped a lot to set up a SSH key for my GitHub account so that I could commit and push my changes to the remote repository. 
                The other resource was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acsZQ2Aq6-M">YouTube video</a> by a channel called themesCode 
                which demonstrated how to add pictures to your website depending on where the picture is located on your machine in relation to 
                the working directory. The Piazza forum where classmates mention their problem with linking their local repository to the remote one 
                had given me a warning that I would need to set up a SSH key so I wasn't alarmed when I encountered the same error.
