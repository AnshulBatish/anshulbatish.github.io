    <h3>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>My biggest obstacle throughout the course of this assignment was getting familiar with git and the process
            of setting git on my terminal. To get started on my journey of learning about git I downnloaded the Git-it
            desktop app that was referenced in the README file. The first four assignments were very straightforward
            since it required using basic git commands and inputting my GitHub username. It was on the fifth exercise-
            linking my local repository with a remote one - where I experienced a significant setback. Even though I
            followed
            the steps listed on the tutorial, I kept experiencing an error where my terminal was not linked to my GitHub
            repo.
            I copy and pasted the error message I recieved into a search engine to diagnose and resolve the issue. I
            referred
            git's official page to see what to do. After reading some documentation I realized I had to set up a SSH key
            for my
            GitHub account. Following the instructions on the website, I was finally able to link up my terminal with my
            GitHub
            repo. The other problem I experienced is that the name for the branch I had was "main" whereas Git-it
            expected the name
            "master." This name difference - I presume - caused Git-it to not acknowledge that I completed the task. I
            confirmed that
            I had truly pushed my commits to my GitHub repo.

    </ul>

    <h3>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>From attending lectures and reading supplementary html documentation, I learned useful commands to present
            textual and visual
            information in an organized manner with headers and lists - for example. It was through this assignment
            though that I learned
            the importance of planning things out ahead of time instead of making adjustments on the fly. Just like in
            CS161 and CS162,
            the purpose of the design document was to weed out logical errors and have a blueprint so that the coding
            aspect would take
            significantly less time. Similarly, I found it more efficient and helpful to create a rough sketch of how I
            would want my webpage
            to look like before hard coding it. Just seeing the code makes it quite difficult to visualize what the
            final product would look
            like. Instead of having to constatnly refresh the site to see how every small change would look, planning it
            out ahead of time
            saved a lot of time and mental strain. In addition to having prior knowledge of the importance of planning,
            I had very faint
            experience with HTML from my web design class in my freshman year of high school. Since I had not worked or
            been exposed to HTML
            since freshman year, essentially all my understanding of HTML had been reset and I'm learning it on a clean
            slate.

    <h3>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in
        completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In addition to lecture materials, there were a few web resources that I found particularly useful when
            completing assignment 1.
            As mentioned in the challenges section, <a
                href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account">the
                official documentation</a>
            from GitHub helped a lot to set up a SSH key for my GitHub account so that I could commit and push my
            changes to the remote repository.
            The other resource was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acsZQ2Aq6-M">YouTube video</a> by a
            channel called themesCode
            which demonstrated how to add pictures to your website depending on where the picture is located on your
            machine in relation to
            the working directory. The Piazza forum where classmates mention their problem with linking their local
            repository to the remote one
            had given me a warning that I would need to set up a SSH key so I wasn't alarmed when I encountered the same
            error.

    <h2>Entry 2 - 10/25/21</h2>
    <h3>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve
        those problems?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>One primary struggle I was encountering as I was doing this assignment was getting all the pictures of the
            items to
            be centered within the flex box it was contained in. I had reffered to w3 to learn how to scale the pictures
            down to
            the desired size and had thought that I had found the solution - using object-fit: contain When implementing
            it however,
            the size of the pictures had become what I desired, but the larger pictures were shifted to the left of the
            flex box. I
            tried experimenting using margin and padding to try and shift those pictures towards the center, however,
            that would cause
            all of the other pictures that were already centered to move off axis as well. After trial and error, I
            decided to search up
            explicitly how to center an image inside a flex box. It was there that I found out that I needed to set the
            margin on the
            left and right of the picture to auto, as well as displaying the pictures as a block element, before the
            pictures were finally
            centered and resembled the mock site.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you
        already knew?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>What I learned the most from this assignment is getting a much more solid understanding of how flex boxes
            operate and how I can position items on the screen exactly as I see fit. The special insight I had into flex boxes were
            from a combination of lecutre videos, lecture notes, MDN Web Docs and w3 schools. Rereading the information about
            how flex boxes work from each source solidified my understanding of them, and more importantly, allowed me to
            refer to many sources the next time I need to clarify something about flex boxes. The aspect which I already had a
            good grasp over was my understanding of specificty to apply css to certain aspects.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class
        Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Revisiting lecture videos in conjuction with lecture notes offered lots of assistance when I needed to
            quickly clarify how to format or implement a design element in css. For my more complicated questions - questions regarding
            concepts and functionality - I used w3 schools extensively because of their simple explanations about commands. . 
            I used MDN Web Docs frequently as well to grasp how flex boxes work. After getting most of my site to look 
            similar to the mock, I had a pestering issue where the header would not extend the background color all the way 
            to the edge of the viewport. After spending significant time trying to identify and resolve the issue on my own and 
            not being able to, I went to office hours to have a TA look over my css. They also spent some time fiddling around to 
            see what needed to be done in order to extend the header background color. Eventually, they pointed out that I should 
            set the body to 100% and align-self to center, helping to extend the header to the edges of the viewport. The TA had 
            inadvertantly made me realize some unnecessary lines of code that I was cleaned up. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I Googled how to center an image, how to resize an image, and how to implement hover controls in order to 
            kink out major apsects of the website and complete the assignment. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Entry 3 - 11/08/21</h2>
    <h3>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve
        those problems?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The assignment as a whole was very challenging for me because I essentially dove head first into java without
            really having a good understanding of how javascript works. It was through trial and error that I completed the parts
            of the assignment that I did. My first major problem arised with properly clearing the fields after the user clicks
            to publish the post and alerting at the right time. Even though all the fields were entered an alert would continue to 
            show up, but the post would still publish. I asked fellow classmates what I should do, and after implementing 
            their solutions, it still wouldn't work. It wasn't until I spoke with the TA that I realized my logic for checking whether
            the fields were empty was flawed. To resolve this issue I repositioned my function where I checked whether the fields were 
            empty or not. The other major issue I was having and currently am facing is with filtering the posts - specifically with 
            removing the proper DOM elements and making them reappear. After hours and hours of tinkering and debugging, I was able finally 
            able to somewhat filter the posts by using "article[i].remove()" as opposed to "container.removeChild(article[i]".
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you
        already knew?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I learned about the importance of anonymous functions, using global variables, and how to properly remove DOM elements. 
            Coming from programming with C++ exclusively, it was quite unusual not having to include a semi-colon after each statement, having to 
            assign a data type for each variable declared, and not having to dynamically allocating memory to utilize an array. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class
        Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In order to get initial exposure to the functionality with javascript I watched all the lectures through the media gallery. 
            This was good enough to devise an initial plan for how to go about adding posts, but as I soon realized, I was still largely 
            clueless as to how to actually write it out. The most helpful resource throughout this assignment was stackOverflow. Copying and 
            pasting my error message to Google led me to forums where people faced similar issues. The helpful people who pointed out the 
            problem and offered a solution allowed me to realize my mistakes and how to fix them. Additionally, I used the MDN documentation 
            to understand how specific functions work and to see examples of how to use them.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            One of the things I had to Google was was data attributes work. I was led to the MDN documentation which explained what the purpose of these 
            data attributes are and how they can be accessed. I had to seperately Google how to add and assign values to data attributes after a creating 
            a new post. The other thing I had to Google was how to check which boxes are checked in the conditions section. I saw that there was something to 
            denote that the box was checked in the html but I wasn't sure how to access this selected value. After Googling did I learn that I can use a built in 
            funciton to see which options the user has selected.
